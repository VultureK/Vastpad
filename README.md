## What is it?
Have you ever wanted a free open source notepad that has total freedom and is endless? Well, here it is, I made it.

So far you can change the font size, the font color, and the font itself. Though, the headings buttons are broke, the one font in the fonts list as well.

So yeah, have fun with this.
